👋 Hi, I’m Oleksandr – a motivated Finance & Banking student based in Geneva, Switzerland.

💼 I’m currently studying Finance, Banking, Insurance, and Stock Markets, with a strong interest in how emerging technologies are transforming the financial sector.

💻 Alongside my studies, I’m actively developing skills in Python programming and blockchain development. I have hands-on experience with:
- Smart contracts (Solidity, Remix IDE)
- Web3 and decentralized applications
- APIs and automation
- SQL and web scraping

⚙️ I enjoy building tools and prototypes that combine finance and technology — from backend systems to blockchain-based financial logic.

📈 Passionate about the future of fintech and decentralized finance (DeFi), I’m eager to contribute to meaningful projects.

🤝 Open to collaborations, internships, and junior opportunities in finance, Web3, or fintech domains.
